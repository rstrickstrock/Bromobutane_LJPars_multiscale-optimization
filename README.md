# Bromobutane_LJPars_multiscale-optimization

This GitHub repository contains supplementary material for the multiscale force field parameter optimization of 1-bromobutane's and 2-bromobutane's Lennard-Jones parameters.

Included are:
-  structure and topology files of 1-bromobutane and 2-bromobutane
-  force field files
-  simulation inputs (i.e. .mdp files)
-  the optimization toolbox FFLOW
-  scripts and data sets to train machine learning surrogate models


This repository's purpose is to provide all necessary files to reproduce the results represented in the following dissertation (add info here, as soon as available).


NOTE:
additional third party software, e.g. GROMACS or Python, is required and NOT included in this repository. They need to be installed separately.
